# ULTRA AIM PRO

Welcome to Final ULTRA AIM PRO, a sophisticated predictive modeling tool designed to showcase advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.

## Description

UltraAim Pro is an advanced system designed to optimize the balance between performance and reliability in computational devices. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and custom neural network models developed on the Ultra96 platform, it adapts in real-time to ensure optimal performance without compromising the hardware's durability.

## Features

- **Main Application**: The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for the application.
- **Logging**: `app_logging.py` manages logging, keeping track of events and errors.
- **Dependencies**: All necessary Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Execution**: `Run_Main_App.bat` is a convenient script for Windows users to start the application.
- **Data Handling**: The `data` folder stores datasets and related scripts.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The `gui` folder contains all components related to the user interface.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and utilities are located within the `utils` folder.
- **Model**: The `model` folder includes neural network models and training scripts.
- **Graphics**: UI graphics are stored in the `graphics` folder.
- **Temporary Files**: The `temp` folder is used for storing temporary files.
- **Saved Outputs**: The `saved files` folder is designated for outputs and serialized models.
